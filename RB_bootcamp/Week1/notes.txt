* Whenever you define a function that returns an elemet, you can either render the element by calling the function or by doing the following: <FunctionWithElement />

* What I mentioned before of rendering an element by a function is called function component. A component is basically an independent and reusable piece of code.

* There are two main different types of components:
    - Function components (more modern and most common)
    - Class components (older and not as much used)

* You can pass in arguments to your components using props. Props are aobject with the passed arguments. Props are immutable. If you try to change them, an exception is thrown.

* Sometimes you want to keep track of value changes that occur in a field (ex. keeping track of changes in the input field). The values that we are tracking are called State.
