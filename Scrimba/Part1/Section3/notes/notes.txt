* We have seen something interesting happen in this section, related to the rendering of an array that we changed values when clicking a button.
    - When we clicked the button, the new element was inserted in the array.
    - But, altough the array was modified, the page remained with the initial values of the array.
    - The expected behaviour was that the page would present the updated values of the array, something that actually did not happen.
    - To solve this problem, we introduced the concept of state.

* First, let's clarify the concept of prop.
    - We can view props as properties being passed to a component, that are needed for such component to work properly.
    - This is a similar behaviour to what we expect in functions, where we receive arguments "from above".
    - One important aspect to notice here is props passed to a component are immutable, meaning the component receiving such props can't modify them.

* State refers to values that are managed by the component, similar to variables declared inside a function.
    - Any time we have changing values that should be saved/display, we most likely will use state.
    - In React, state is managed using the React.useState method.

* The React.useState method returns an array with tho positions:
    - In the first position, we have the initial state value (that can be set when we first initialize the useState method). This is the value whose changes we are going to track.
    - In the second position, we have a function whose purpose is to update the value of the state defined above.
        -> Whenever we run this function, our frontend will re-render.
        -> This function passes as parameter the old value of the variable we want to change state. Instead of just using directly the value of this variable, we should use the callback with the old value, which is a best practice.
            - We are not guaranteed on the order of execution of our update functions, so using the callback guarantees us that we will have the most updated state for that variable.

* Whenever we change the state of an attribute defined in a component, React will re-render all the child components of that component, either if that component depends to that attribute or not.


* There are multiple ways of maintaining state in our application, particularlly when it comes to maintain state in our child components.
    -> One way that we can do it is by maintaining state in the child components, and let them handle their on state and its respective changes.
        - This might be a bad approach in the case that this state is initialized based on props that come from the parent component.
        - We call state that is initialized by incoming prop, derived state.
        - There is a problem with this approach, and the problem is that we will have two sources of truth: the parent component and the child component.
    
    -> Another way we can do this is by maintaining the state in the main component and then pass down to components the functions that updates the state


* One of the most important things we do in React is conditional rendering.
    -> This just means that we are going to render things based on a condition.
        - One of the operators is the && operator, that we normally see in the if statements. If the left hand side is false, it won't render the element. If positive, the element will be rendered.
        - The other operator is the ternary (?) operator.

    -> This kind of conditional rendering is not possible in traditional HTML, where you need to render everything that you hardcode into it.
        - With React's conditional rendering, you can select what element to render based upon on a certain condition being met.

=> Forms

* The most common way to keep track of forms changes in form elements, is by using a callback function that will be called whenever something changes in the form element (the famous onChange event)
    -> The problem with this inital approach is that we might be tempted to create an onChange function for each and every element of our form.
        - This works fine when our form has 2/3 elements (rare scenario)
        - There is a better way to keep track of this changes, which is to create a general change function, and give each element a name tag, which corresponds to the key property of the object to be updated.
            -- Having this information about what field was changed, we can also access the new value (it's inside the event parameter passed to our callback function)
            -- event.target.name corresponds to the key changed and the event.target.value to the new added value

* One important thing to keep in mind here is that we must add a value property to our form field.
    -> This happens because we must have only one source of truth, which is a part of something called "controlled inputs"
    -> Instead of having the value we insert dictate what is being displayed in the forn, we must have that value coming from the respective state property.

* When you submit a form, you want to run the following command on the onSubmit function: event.preventDefault().
    -> If you do that, your input fields won't go into the URL and the page won't reload.

* Some trivia about forms:
    -> In a vanilla JS app, at what point in the form submission process do you gather all the data from the filled-out form?
        - Right before the form is submitted.
        - Normally we listen for an event event, and then collect the data inserted on each field.

    -> In a React app, when do you gather all the data from the filled-out form?
        - In React, we don't wait for the form to be submitted to collect all the data from it's fields.
        - The data is collected as the form is being changed (ex. in a text element we change state in every keystroke).
        - This data is held in local state.

    -> Which attribute in the form elements (value, name, onChange, etc.) should match the property name being held in state for that input?
        - The "name" attribute.

    -> What's different about saving the data from a checkbox element vs. other form elements?
        - In the other elements, we are storing the values with the "value" attribute.
        - In the case of a checkbox element, we are changing the value based on the checked attribute.

    -> How do you watch for a form submit? How can you trigger a form submit?
        - You can watch a form submit by having an onSubmit handler on the form element.
        - The way you can trigger the submission is by either having a button on the form or an input of type submit.


* React has 3 main primary tasks:
    (1) -> Works with DOM/browser to render UI to the page
    (2) -> Manages state for us between render cycles (i.e. state values are "remembered" from one render to the next)
    (3) -> Keeps UI updated whenever state changes occur

* React can't handle stuff on its own (called [out]side effects):
    -> API/database interactions
    -> Subscriptions (ex. web sockets on a chat)
    -> local storage
    -> side effects is basically anything React isn't in charge of
