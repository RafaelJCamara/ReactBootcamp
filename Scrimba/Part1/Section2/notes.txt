* If we want to insert re-usability of our components, we must not make them use hard coded information.
    - We must, somehow, be able to let information change.
    - For example, if we have a funcion that only returns the sum of 1 plus 2, the usabbility of this function is very limited/scoped.
    - But if we send the numbers to add as parameters, now we can re-use the function elsewhere in different scenarios.

* There's a way on which we can insert regular javascript inside JSX.
    - And the way we do so is by using our javascript inside {}

* Whenever we crate a component in another file, we always do "export default" the function that creates the component, so that it can be imported by another function.
