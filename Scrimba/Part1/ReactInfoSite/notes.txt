* One of the reasons why people like React is that is enables us to create more modular code, and avoid those long HTML pages like the old times.
    - React is composable, meaning that we create small pieces to create something greater than the individual pieces.

* Another reason why people like React is that it has a declarative style.
    - Doing this in an imperative way is more verbose.

* React uses something called JSX (Javascript XML)
    - This is a flavor of JavaScript with HTML.
    - The element returned by JSX is a simple JavaScript object

* When rendering in the root element, we must guarantee that there is only one parent element.
    - If we want to render multiple sibling elements, we must wrap them up with a single parent element (ex. inside a div)

* JSX elements are regular javascript objects.

* Components in React must be writen in Pascal case.
    - They are mostly created using functions.
    - As said before, they should be writen in Pascal case.
    - In order to call the component, we should use HTML like notation, with a self closing tag with the name of the component/function.
    - A component is a function that returns React elements.

* To style elements, we must use className instead of class.
